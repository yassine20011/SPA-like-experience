            "Pwned Passwords" are collections of real-world passwords that have been compromised in various data
            breaches. Due to this exposure, continuing to use these passwords poses significant security risks, as they
            can be exploited to access other accounts. These compromised passwords are available for online search and
            can be downloaded for integration into other online systems. Learn more about the privacy measures
            implemented by HIBP to safeguard searched passwords.

                <p id="message" class="text-gray-500 text-sm">This page uses the Pwned Passwords service to check if
                    your password
                    has
                    been leaked in a data breach. This page does not send your password over the internet. Your password
                    is hashed using SHA-1 and only the first 5 characters of the hash are sent to the Pwned Passwords
                    API.
                    The API then returns a list of leaked passwords that match the hash prefix. This page then checks if
                    your password is in the list. If your password is found in the list, it means that your password has
                    been leaked in a data breach. If your password is not found in the list, it means that your password
                    has not been leaked in a data breach. </p>
